# Employees' Mode of Transportation Analysis and Prediction

This project requires you to understand what mode of transport employees prefers to commute to their office. The data includes employee information about their mode of transport as well as their personal and professional details like age, salary, and work exp. We need to predict whether or not an employee will use private transport. Also, which variables are a significant predictor behind this decision.
